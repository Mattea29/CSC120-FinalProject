This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.

- yes, no commands correspond to 1 (yes) and 2(no)
- when on the path, you can press 1 to move forward and 2 to move back
- during fights, press 1 to attack and 2 to use power up
- to use power up, user must type in the name of the power up (this will be changed to correspond to integers which the user can just type in instead)
- to use stronger attacks, user must use power ups
- to revive, user will be able to enter certain buildings and revive, or use certain powerUps to restore HP
